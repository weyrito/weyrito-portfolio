# Thomas Fouquet - Portfolio

  

Interactive portfolio of a cybersecurity student with terminal interface.

  

## 🎯 Description

  

Personal portfolio showcasing my skills, projects and experiences in cybersecurity and development. The site offers a traditional user interface as well as an interactive terminal for original navigation.

  

**Note:** This project was initially created to test Claude Sonnet 4 capabilities, but the results were so impressive that I decided to publish it as my main portfolio, replacing my previous one.
