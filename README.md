# Thomas Fouquet - Portfolio

  

Interactive portfolio of a cybersecurity student with terminal interface.

  

## 🎯 Description

  

Personal portfolio showcasing my skills, projects and experiences in cybersecurity and development. The site offers a traditional user interface as well as an interactive terminal for original navigation.

  

**Note:** This project was initially created to test Claude Sonnet 4 capabilities, but the results were so impressive that I decided to publish it as my main portfolio, replacing my previous one.

  

## ✨ Features

  

- Modern and responsive portfolio interface

- Interactive terminal with Unix commands

- Command-based navigation

- Cybersecurity theme

- Custom CSS animations

- Modular JavaScript architecture

- JSON-based data management

  

## 🛠️ Technologies used

  

- HTML5

- CSS3 (with CSS Variables and Grid/Flexbox)

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)

- Responsive design

- JSON for data storage

  

**Tech stack philosophy:** The technology stack is intentionally kept simple and lightweight, focusing on vanilla web technologies without frameworks or complex dependencies. This approach ensures fast loading times, easy maintenance, and demonstrates proficiency with core web technologies.
